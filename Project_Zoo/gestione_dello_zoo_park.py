'''
This module provides some classes and functions that are needed to manage a virtual zoo

Classes:
    Animal: represents an animal with a name, species, age, height, width, habitat and health
    Fence: represents an enclosure with a list of Animal, area, temperature and habitat
    ZooKeeper: represents a zookeeper with a name, surname and an id
    Zoo: represents a zoo with a list of Fence and a list of ZooKeeper

Functions:
    Fence.is_available: checks if an animal can be put in the fence
    ZooKeeper.add_animal: adds an animal to an enclosure
    ZooKeeper.remove_animal: remove an animal from an enclosure
    ZooKeeper.feed: feed an animal (increases health and size)
    ZooKeeper.clean: returns a float with the time needed to clean a fence
    Zoo.describe_zoo: shows every information inside of the zoo. (Zookeepers, fences and animals)
